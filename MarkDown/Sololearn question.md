#The Best Way To Practice For Long Term Success?

Friday, 23. February 2018

This is a quesion posed by [Melissa](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/5615358) on SoloLearn.  Melissa goes on to write:

*I'm really striving to make coding a potential career in the most effective way possible, but I'm easily discouraged because there's so many components to learn. How can I practice more efficiently and move myself forward? I feel very much like I'm floating in an ocean in a boat with no oars.*

When I first saw this question the thing that most struck me was the large number of responses (111 when I last looked).  My immediate reaction was not to leave another response - how could I add anything useful.  But the question and the responses kept running through my mind as the day went on so I thought I would provide my own thoughts on this, my first blog platform.  I hope that in doing so I do not inadvertantly offend or discourage.  Indeed my intention is quite the reverse.

At the outset I should make it abundantly clear that these are my thoughts and that there are others with far greater experience who can in all likelyhood provide more authoratative advice.  The thoughts here are loosely addressed to Malissa (whose initial coding choices appear to be related to the web) but may be of interest to others.  These comments therefore assume that the principle interest is in coding for the web.

I should should also say to anyone reading this post that it is the second real post on this site.  All other posts are simply test posts which have been left in place so that people can experiment with the functionality of the site.

##My own thoughts

My initial astonishment at the number of responses was probably due to naivete.  I am now inclined to think that many, if not all, people learning to programme experience similar thoughts and emotions.  My own experience is probably typical.  I will spend time, often a lot of time, studying a language in depth, doing exercises and tutorials and finding, like Melissa, that there is always more to learn.  Not only that but inevitably arriving at a stage where I have what a story writer calls 'writers block'.  I might have an idea but I lack the motivation for reasons I cannot quite grasp.  Inevitably, for me, I move on to other things and lose all that understanding I had.  It is frustrating and demoralizing.

In my own case I have returned again and again to programming tutorials hoping that things will be different.

It was with little expectation of achieving anything that I signed up with SoloLearn with the express intention of trying to learn something useful about web development generally.  Now, some six months or so on, I look back with some satisfaction to see that I appear to have learnt more than I had initially expected.  Compare my [first code](https://code.sololearn.com/W0r9JuHdKGpa/#html) with the code for [this blog application](https://code.sololearn.com/WnPgVF2RuIg9/#html).  I put this relative success down to a number of factors.

- SoloLearn now offers a web app which provides a very singular experience of community.
- The ability to post codes on the code playground gives a sense that you are not coding for yourself alone and also provides the occasional feedback.
- My choice of subject matter immediately gave me the chance to see the results of coding - web pages and content are visual.  I am not sure that this applies so forcefully with other things like C++, Java, Python and so on which do not provide a visual feedback on the code playground.

I find that I am much more motivated if I have a particular goal and after studying html, css, and JavaScript I put my first efforts into filling in the gaps.  Animation was one of the things which I definitely wanted to learn about, the canvas was another area that interested me and on it went.  With each of these areas of interest I was motivated by the thought that what I learnt could be uploaded onto the code playground.

Of course not everything went smoothly or encouragingly.  I learnt at an early stage that there were certain things you sould not post - if you did you got downvoted.  This was confusing to me but a number of people came to my aid [in a response to my own question](https://www.sololearn.com/Discuss/668061/how-should-we-think-of-down-votes).  The idea of upvoting and downvoting is something I have found difficult to predict or understand and has not always served as an encouragement.  You will, for instance, find 2 upvotes for my first code but not one for this blog application.  My own goal has been to learn to code and I agree with many of those who responded to Melissa's question that you should have a goal and you should work on a project of your own if you can.

Although I have found SoloLearn to be a very positive influence I have also tried other learning sites such as Codecademy, and Khan Academy as well as various YouTube videos and tutorials and online written turorials particularly those on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) who offer all sorts of helpful material.


##Freecodecamp

There is one source which I have have found particularly helpful to me and I believe that I would not have made the same personal progress if I had not also signed up with [freecodecamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  Freecodecamp takes a different approach to most other learning site.  You are presented with one 'challenge' at a time.

The first challenges are almost trivial and I was inclined to think that I would not continue for long but if you are persistent you will reach a stage when the [first real challenge](https://code.sololearn.com/WQmrabqnhdd6/#html)  arrives with something of a shock.  At least that is the way it felt for me.  Now I am able to look back on it and see it as a relatively simple project.  However, at the time, the challenge provided me with a sense of achievement and the feeling that perhaps I would one day be able to code something much more elaborate.

Other challenges will encourage you to apply JavaScript and so in time your ability to use the code and apply it will be enhanced.

Freecodecamp also encourages community participation through facebook.  Although I have not taken that route I believe it would be of great benefit if you are comfortable with facebook.


##Concluding comments

There is no doubt in my own mind that anyone hoping to make progress with software coding will need to have a degree of determination.  Most of the answers to the question posed by Melissa mention practice.  Practice is important because it makes things easier as you progress.  Learning to code is a bit like learning to do anything new.  At first things are unfamiliar and awkward but the more practice and familiarity you can gain the easier things will become.

Having a goal is also important.  Even a small goal like leaning how to make a circular div on the page for instance.  At first it may be a mystery or if you have read about it you may find that in practice it just refuses to appear on the page.  This is all useful to you, even the negative aspects, since they all teach.

Take part in what the SoloLearn community has to offer and if you can, find someone who will be willing to comment and guide you at times.

Join freecodecamp, not perhaps immediately, but after studying each of the html, css, and JavaScript courses offered by SoloLearn and and after you have started to write your own code even if this is only through following various tutorials.
