# Welcome to TinyBlog

Thursday, 16. February 2018

TinyBlog is a small blog site.  The original idea for the site came from the Pharo MOOC which uses and example blog to illustrate the use of smalltalk in developing web applications.

The title 'TinyBlog' now seems appropriate for present purposes since in many ways this is what inspired me to learn more about html, css and javascript.
