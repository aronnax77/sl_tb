# Welcome to TinyBlog

Thursday, 16. February 2018

Wecome to TinyBlog.  TinyBlog is a small blog site which was originally inspired through participation in the Pharo MOOC which used an example of the same name to illustrate how Pharo SmallTalk could be used for web development.  The title 'TinyBlog' now seems appropriate for present purposes since this is what inspired me to learn more about html, css and javascript.

The present design has deliberately been kept simple both in its appearance and its features.  The main aim has been to accomodate, as far as possible, the limitations imposed by the code playground.  I have not, for this reason, been able to make use of server-side scripting or database facilities.  Since this is very much a first for me I also wanted to keep the time and effort involved to a manageable level and what you see here can be thought of as a first working draft which can be modified and extended at a later date.

Although simple this has provided the opportunity to explore a number of ideas including:

- practical matters such as how to write a post and format it for the blog.
- how to enter html formatted posts into a web page.
- design considerations such as the appearance of the page for large, medium and small screens.
- translating the visual design into a working application
- obtaining a domain name and making the page live on the web.

In addition to these thoughts I also wanted to make use of recent study material including:

- CSS grids
- Flexbox
- Vue.js
- the fetch api

The end result is by no means ideal as a working blog but does do most of what was intended, has been a great learning aid and is now running live at www.tinyblog.tk.

New insights also provided material for a future post or two if I find myself developing an interest in blogging.  For the present, however, I offer this as my latest endevour.  **Please note that this article is the only real post at this time.**  I have left the test posts in place so that others might experiment with the functionality presently availabe.

Future modifications might include:

- some sort of routing
- a tree like menu for both categories and dates
- a way of presenting a limited number of posts at a time - ***I am being optimistic!***

Hoping that this may be of interest to others and wishing all aspiring software enthusiasts good fortune.
